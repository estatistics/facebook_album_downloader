### Features

The main feature of this application is to allow users to download Facebook albums after entering the album link. When users enter a Facebook album link and click the "download" button, the application uses a tool called Puppeteer to scrape the HTML of the album and then presents these files as a downloadable ZIP file. Additionally, the application also includes a feature that warns the user if they are leaving the page while the download process may not have been completed yet.
